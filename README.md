## üåü Introduction

Object detection is a computer vision technique used to identify and locate objects within an image or video. This project aims to provide a comprehensive implementation of popular object detection algorithms, including YOLO, SSD, and Faster R-CNN.

## ‚ú® Features

- Implementation of popular object detection models
- Pre-trained model weights for quick setup
- Customizable training scripts
- Evaluation metrics for model performance
- Visualization tools for detected objects

## üõ† Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ffaahhimm/object-detection.git
    cd object-detection
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

To use the object detection models provided in this repository, follow the instructions below:

1. **Run inference on an image:**
    ```sh
    python inference.py --model yolov5 --image path/to/image.jpg
    ```

2. **Train a model on a custom dataset:**
    ```sh
    python train.py --model yolov5 --dataset path/to/dataset
    ```

3. **Evaluate the model performance:**
    ```sh
    python evaluate.py --model yolov5 --dataset path/to/validation_dataset
    ```
